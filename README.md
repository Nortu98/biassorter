Ranking things and anything.
Credit taken from biasorter on Tumblr.com.
This nifty little project takes user input of things they'd like to rank/sort and writes them to local array.
Sorter takes 2 options and has you rank one over the other, allowing options for equal preference/draws.
At the end the sorter takes overall ranking of all items and sorts them into a list with numerical ranking.
Popular these days among fandoms, specifically kpop, where this sorter originally was birthed.
